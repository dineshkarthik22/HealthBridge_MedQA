      "heading": "What is a pollen allergy?",
      "content": "A pollen allergy is a type of seasonal allergy triggered by pollen. Pollen is a powdery particle that flowering plants, trees, grass and weeds release to help fertilize other plants of the same species. It travels by floating through the air, but when it lands on surfaces it appears as a fine yellow dust. These tiny yellow particles can easily end up in your nose, eyes or lungs.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nIf you have a pollen allergy, your immune system thinks pollen is a dangerous intruder. It produces chemicals to fight off the pollen, and you experience an allergic reaction. Sneezing, congestion and puffy eyes are just a few of the symptoms people with pollen allergies may have. Medications can help you manage a pollen allergy.\nPollen allergies are typically seasonal and affect people when plants pollinate. Generally, trees pollinate in spring, followed by grass in summer and weeds in fall. In areas with warmer climates, symptoms of pollen allergies can begin as early as January or occur multiple times per year.\nA pollen allergy is sometimes known as seasonal allergic rhinitis."

      "content": "There are three sources of pollen: trees, grass and weeds. Each of these plants pollinates at different times of the year, depending on where you live.\nUsually the first allergen to appear, tree pollen is most common in March through May, but can appear as early as January in warmer climates. Some of the species of trees that cause the most allergy symptoms are:\nBirch.Oak.Cedar.\nBirch.\nOak.\nCedar.\nGrass causes pollen allergy symptoms in late spring and summer. It can sometimes overlap with tree pollen and weed pollen seasons. Grass pollen is light, and the wind can easily carry it. This means the grass in your neighbor’s yard could cause your allergies.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the most common types of grass that cause allergy symptoms are:\nBahia.Bermuda.Fescue.Johnson.Kentucky blue.\nBahia.\nBermuda.\nFescue.\nJohnson.\nKentucky blue.\nWeed pollen, especially from ragweed, is the third source of pollen allergies. Weed pollen starts in the summer and ends in the fall. Ragweed, the most common weed allergen, grows in 49 states and can travel hundreds of miles through the air. This makes it especially hard to avoid. One plant can produce about 1 billion grains of pollen.\nOther species of weeds that cause pollen allergies include:\nBurning bush.Cocklebur.Lamb’s quarters.\nBurning bush.\nCocklebur.\nLamb’s quarters.\nApproximately 20 million people in the U.S. have seasonal allergies due to pollen."

Some questions you can expect may include how long you’ve had symptoms or if symptoms happen during certain times of the year.\nThey can diagnose a pollen allergy using a skin prick test or a blood test.\nSkin prick test: An allergist will use a thin needle to prick your skin with a tiny amount of pollen. They then check to see if your skin reacts to it. Your skin will turn red, swell or become itchy if you’re allergic.Specific IgE blood test: This is a blood test that looks for a specific antibody your immune system produces against pollen.\nSkin prick test: An allergist will use a thin needle to prick your skin with a tiny amount of pollen.

These include:\nAntihistamines like cetirizine (Zyrtec®) or loratadine (Claritin®). These work by blocking histamine, which is the chemical your body produces in response to an allergen. They come in pill, liquid or nasal spray form.Nasal sprays containing corticosteroids like fluticasone (Flonase®) work by reducing inflammation in your nasal passages.Medications that combine antihistamines and decongestants like loratadine/pseudoephedrine (Claritin-D®) and fexofenadine/pseudoephedrine (Allegra-D®).Medications to help manage asthma like inhaled or oral bronchodilators and inhaled steroids.Leukotriene inhibitors like montelukast (Singulair®). Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene, which causes inflammation during an allergic reaction.Decongestants to help clear your nose by shrinking your nasal passages. Some examples are pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®) or phenylephrine (Sudafed PE®). Don’t take decongestants for longer than five days as it can cause side effects in people with certain health conditions and become addictive.

You receive a series of injections that contain pollen. The amount of pollen in the injection gradually increases, which builds up your tolerance. A healthcare provider gives you allergy shots.\nWhile it may not be possible to avoid pollen altogether, you can change your daily habits to try to minimize how much time you spend outside. For example, avoid being outside on a warm, windy spring day when pollen is high. Pollen tends to be highest early in the day and into early afternoon."
