      "content": "High blood pressure is when the force of blood pushing against your artery walls is consistently too high. This damages your arteries over time and can lead to serious complications like heart attack and stroke. “Hypertension” is another word for this common condition.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nHealthcare providers call high blood pressure a “silent killer” because you usually don’t have any symptoms. So, you may not be aware that anything is wrong, but the damage is still occurring within your body.\nBlood pressure (BP) is the measurement of the pressure or force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls. Your BP reading has two numbers:\nThe top number is the systolic blood pressure, which measures the pressure on your artery walls when your heart beats or contracts.The bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure. This measures the pressure on your artery walls between beats when your heart is relaxing.\nThe top number is the systolic blood pressure, which measures the pressure on your artery walls when your heart beats or contracts.\nThe bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure. This measures the pressure on your artery walls between beats when your heart is relaxing.\nHealthcare providers measure blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\nGetting your blood pressure checked is the only way to know if it’s too high. You can do this by seeing a healthcare provider for a yearly checkup, even if you feel healthy. You won’t feel sick if you have high blood pressure. So, these checkups are crucial and can be life-saving. If your BP is above the normal range, your provider will recommend lifestyle changes and/or medications to lower your numbers.\nDefinitions of high blood pressure vary slightly depending on where you live. In the U.S., healthcare providers define high blood pressure (hypertension) as:\nAdvertisement\nA top number (systolic blood pressure) of at least 130 mmHg, and/orA bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) of at least 80 mmHg.\nA top number (systolic blood pressure) of at least 130 mmHg, and/or\nA bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) of at least 80 mmHg.\nIn Europe, healthcare providers define hypertension as:\nA top number of at least 140 mmHg, and/orA bottom number of at least 90 mmHg.\nA top number of at least 140 mmHg, and/or\nA bottom number of at least 90 mmHg.\nHigh blood pressure is very common. It affects 47% of adults in the U.S. This equals about 116 million people. Of those, 37 million have a blood pressure of at least 140/90 mmHg.\nHigh blood pressure caused or contributed to over 670,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2020.\nThe World Health Organization estimates that globally, over 1.2 billion people ages 30 to 79 have hypertension. About 2 in 3 of those individuals live in low- or middle-income countries."

      "content": "Usually, high blood pressure causes no signs or symptoms. That’s why healthcare providers call it a “silent killer.” You could have high blood pressure for years and not know it. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 46% of adults with hypertension don’t know they have it.\nWhen your blood pressure is 180/120 mmHg or higher, you may experience symptoms like headaches, heart palpitations or nosebleeds. Blood pressure this high is a hypertensive crisis that requires immediate medical care."

Causes of this more common type of high blood pressure (about 90% of all adult cases in the U.S.) include aging and lifestyle factors like not getting enough exercise.Secondary hypertension. Causes of this type of high blood pressure include different medical conditions or a medication you’re taking.\nPrimary hypertension.

Causes of this type of high blood pressure include different medical conditions or a medication you’re taking.\nPrimary and secondary high blood pressure (hypertension) can co-exist. For example, a new secondary cause can make blood pressure that’s already high get even higher.\nYou might also hear about high blood pressure that comes or goes in certain situations. These hypertension types are:\nWhite coat hypertension: Your BP is normal at home but elevated in a healthcare setting.Masked hypertension: Your BP is normal in a healthcare setting but elevated at home.Sustained hypertension: Your BP is elevated in healthcare settings and at home.Nocturnal hypertension: Your BP goes up when you sleep.\nWhite coat hypertension: Your BP is normal at home but elevated in a healthcare setting.\nMasked hypertension: Your BP is normal in a healthcare setting but elevated at home.\nSustained hypertension: Your BP is elevated in healthcare settings and at home.\nNocturnal hypertension: Your BP goes up when you sleep."

Providers usually measure your blood pressure at annual checkups and other appointments.\nIf you have high blood pressure readings at two or more appointments, your provider may tell you that you have high blood pressure. They’ll talk to you about your medical history and lifestyle to identify possible causes.\nIn 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued new blood pressure guidelines. Healthcare providers in the U.S. use these when diagnosing and treating high blood pressure. The guidelines divide blood pressure readings into four categories, listed in the chart below. You have high blood pressure if you fall into the stage 1 hypertension or stage 2 hypertension categories.\nIn the U.S., a high blood pressure diagnosis means your top number is at least 130 and/or your bottom number is at least 80."

Healthcare providers recommend treatment based on your blood pressure readings, the causes of your high blood pressure and your underlying conditions.\nAdvertisement\nYou may be wondering if you can lower your blood pressure naturally. Yes, in some cases, it’s possible to lower your blood pressure without medication. For example, your provider may recommend starting with lifestyle changes if you have elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension.\nHere are some proven ways to lower your blood pressure naturally:\nKeep a weight that’s healthy for you. Your healthcare provider can give you a target range.Eat a healthy diet. An example is the DASH diet. This is a way of eating that’s full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy.Cut down on salt. Ideally, limit your sodium intake to no more than 1,500 milligrams (mg) per day. If this is too difficult at first, you can start by reducing your daily intake by at least 1,000 milligrams.Get enough potassium. Try to consume 3,500 to 5,000 milligrams per day, ideally through the foods you eat rather than supplements. Some foods high in potassium include bananas, avocados and potatoes (with skin).Exercise. Ask your healthcare provider for tips to get started. In general, start slow and work your way up to 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Resistance training (like lifting light weights) is also helpful.Limit alcohol. If you choose to drink beverages containing alcohol, do so in moderation.\nKeep a weight that’s healthy for you.

When the medicine blocks angiotensin II, your blood vessels don’t narrow.Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) block this same hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. ARBs work the same way as ACE inhibitors to keep blood vessels from narrowing.Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels, allowing these vessels to relax.Diuretics (water or fluid pills) flush excess sodium from your body, reducing the amount of fluid in your blood. People often take diuretics with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the production of the angiotensin II hormone, which the body naturally uses to manage blood pressure.
