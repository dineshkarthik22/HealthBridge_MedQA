      "content": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition that happens when you have persistently high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia).\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nHealthy blood sugar (glucose) levels are 70 to 99 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). If you have undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, your levels are typically 126 mg/dL or higher.\nT2D happens because your pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin (a hormone), your body doesn’t use insulin properly, or both. This is different from Type 1 diabetes, which happens when an autoimmune attack on your pancreas results in a total lack of insulin production.\nType 2 diabetes is very common. More than 37 million people in the U.S. have diabetes (about 1 in 10 people), and about 90% to 95% of them have T2D.\nResearchers estimate that T2D affects about 6.3% of the world’s population. T2D most commonly affects adults over 45, but people younger than 45 can have it as well, including children."

      "heading": "What causes Type 2 diabetes?",
      "content": "The main cause of Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance.\nInsulin resistance happens when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don’t respond as they should to insulin. Insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes that’s essential for life and regulating blood sugar levels.\nIf your body isn’t responding to insulin properly, your pancreas has to make more insulin to try to overcome your increasing blood glucose levels (hyperinsulinemia). If your cells become too resistant to insulin and your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to overcome it, it leads to Type 2 diabetes.\nSeveral factors can contribute to insulin resistance, including:\nGenetics.Excess body fat, especially in your belly and around your organs (visceral fat).Physical inactivity.Eating highly processed, high-carbohydrate foods and saturated fats frequently.Certain medications, like long-term corticosteroid use.Hormonal disorders, like hypothyroidism and Cushing syndrome.Chronic stress and a lack of quality sleep.\nGenetics.\nExcess body fat, especially in your belly and around your organs (visceral fat).\nPhysical inactivity.\nEating highly processed, high-carbohydrate foods and saturated fats frequently.\nCertain medications, like long-term corticosteroid use.\nHormonal disorders, like hypothyroidism and Cushing syndrome.\nChronic stress and a lack of quality sleep.\nThe cause of T2D is complex, but researchers know that genetics play a strong role. Your lifetime risk of developing T2D is 40% if you have one biological parent with T2D and 70% if both of your biological parents have it.\nResearchers have identified at least 150 DNA variations linked to the risk of developing T2D — some increase your risk and others decrease it. Some of these variations may directly play a role in insulin resistance and insulin production. Others may increase your risk of T2D by increasing your tendency to have overweight or obesity.\nThese genetic variations likely act together with health and lifestyle factors to influence your overall risk of T2D.\nYou’re more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes if you:\nHave a family history of Type 2 diabetes (biological parent or sibling).Are older than 45.Have overweight or obesity (a BMI greater than 25).Are physically active less than three times a week.Are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian American or Pacific Islander.Had gestational diabetes while pregnant.Have high blood pressure and/or high cholesterol.Have prediabetes.Have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\nHave a family history of Type 2 diabetes (biological parent or sibling).\nAre older than 45.\nHave overweight or obesity (a BMI greater than 25).\nAre physically active less than three times a week.\nAre Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian American or Pacific Islander.\nHad gestational diabetes while pregnant.\nHave high blood pressure and/or high cholesterol.\nHave prediabetes.\nHave polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\nAs T2D symptoms typically come on slowly, it’s important to see your primary care provider regularly if you’re at risk for the condition. This way, they can do screenings, like a basic metabolic panel (BMP), to check on your blood sugar levels. It’s better to catch T2D earlier rather than later.\nAdvertisement"

You typically need to get this test in the morning after an eight-hour fast (nothing to eat or drink except water).

You can learn to predict some of these impacts with time and practice, while others are very difficult or impossible to predict.

There are several types. The most commonly prescribed one is metformin. Your provider may prescribe more than one oral diabetes medication at a time to achieve the best blood glucose management.GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP agonists: These are injectable medications that mainly help manage blood sugar levels in people with T2D.
